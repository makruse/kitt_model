## Building
You can build a distribution by running the following in the project root folder:
    ./gradlew installDist
    
Build files are then stored in the build subdirectory.
    
To generate .project and .classpath files for developing in the Eclipse IDE enter:
    ./gradlew eclipse
    
Other build tasks can be listed with:
    ./gradlew tasks
